                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate

                    GNU 通用公共许可证
                       第三版，2007年6月29日

 版权所有 (C) 2007 自由软件基金会 <https://fsf.org/>

 任何人都可以复制和分发本许可证的完整副本，但不允许修改。

                            前言

  GNU 通用公共许可证是一份面向软件及其他类型作品的自由的、著佐权的许可证。

  大多数软件及其他实用作品的许可证都是为了剥夺你分享和修改作品的自由。相反，GNU 通用公共许可证的目的是保证你分享和修改某程序全部版本的自由——确保它对所有用户都是自由软件。我们，自由软件基金会，在我们的大多数软件中使用 GNU 通用公共许可证；它也适用于任何以这种方式发布的作品。你也可以将它应用于你的程序。

  当我们谈到自由软件时，我们指的是自由，而不是价格。我们的通用公共许可证旨在确保你拥有分发自由软件副本的自由（如果你愿意，可以为此收费），确保你可以收到源代码或者在你需要时可以得到它，确保你可以修改软件或将它的一部分用于新的自由软件，并且确保你知道你可以做这些事情。

  为了保护你的权利，我们需要防止其他人否认你这些权利或要求你放弃这些权利。因此，如果你分发该软件的副本，或者修改它，你就有一定的责任：尊重他人的自由。

  例如，如果你分发这样一个程序的副本，无论是免费的还是收费的，你必须将你获得的自由同样传递给接收者。你必须确保他们也能收到或者可以获得源代码。并且你必须向他们展示这些条款，以便他们知道他们的权利。

  使用 GNU GPL 的开发者通过两个步骤保护你的权利：（1）声明软件的版权；（2）通过本许可证授予你复制、分发和/或修改软件的合法权限。

  为了保护开发者和作者，GPL 明确说明自由软件是没有品质保证的。为了用户和作者的利益，GPL 要求修改版本必须标注为已更改，以便它们的问题不会被错误地归咎于先前版本的作者。

  某些设备被设计为拒绝用户安装或运行其内部软件的修改版本，尽管制造商可以这样做。这与保护用户修改软件自由的目的根本不相容。这种滥用的系统模式发生在个人使用的产品领域，这恰恰是最不可接受的。因此，我们设计了这个版本的 GPL 来禁止这些产品的此类做法。如果这样的问题在其他领域大量出现，我们准备在 GPL 的未来版本中将此条款扩展到这些领域，以保护用户的自由。

  最后，每个程序都不断受到软件专利的威胁。国家不应该允许专利限制通用计算机软件的开发和使用，但在那些允许的国家，我们希望避免专利应用于自由程序而使其变为专有程序的特殊危险。为了防止这种情况，GPL 保证专利不能用于使程序变为非自由的。

  以下是有关复制、分发和修改的详细条款和条件。

                       条款和条件

  0. 定义

  "本许可证"指 GNU 通用公共许可证第三版。

  "版权"也指适用于其他类型作品（如半导体掩模）的版权类法律。

  "程序"指任何受本许可证保护的可版权作品。每个被许可人称为"你"。"被许可人"和"接收者"可以是个人或组织。

  "修改"一个作品是指需要版权许可的方式复制或改编作品的全部或部分，而不是制作完全相同的副本。所得作品称为早期作品的"修改版本"或"基于"早期作品的作品。

  "覆盖作品"是指未修改的程序或基于程序的作品。

  "传播"作品是指在未经许可的情况下，根据适用的版权法，会使你直接或间接承担侵权责任的任何行为，除了在计算机上执行它或修改私有副本。传播包括复制、分发（无论是否修改）、向公众提供，以及在某些国家的其他活动。

  "传送"作品是指任何使其他方能够制作或接收副本的传播。仅通过计算机网络与用户交互，而不转移副本，不是传送。

  一个交互式用户界面在如下范围内显示"适当的法律声明"：它包括一个方便且醒目可见的功能，该功能（1）显示适当的版权声明，（2）告知用户该作品没有品质保证（提供品质保证的情况除外），被许可人可以在本许可证下传送该作品，以及如何查看本许可证的副本。如果界面呈现用户命令或选项列表，例如菜单，列表中的醒目项目符合此标准。

  1. 源代码

  一个作品的"源代码"是指对作品进行修改的首选形式。"目标代码"是指作品的任何非源代码形式。

  "标准接口"是指由公认的标准机构定义的官方标准的接口，或者，对于为特定编程语言指定的接口，是在使用该语言的开发者中广泛使用的接口。

  可执行作品的"系统库"包括除整个作品之外的任何东西，这些东西（a）以打包主要组件的正常形式包含在内，但不是该主要组件的一部分，并且（b）仅用于使作品能够与该主要组件一起使用，或实现对公众可用的源代码形式的标准接口。在这种情况下，"主要组件"是指可执行作品运行所在的特定操作系统（如果有的话）的主要基本组件（内核、窗口系统等），或用于生成作品的编译器，或用于运行它的目标代码解释器。

  目标代码形式作品的"对应源代码"是指生成、安装和（对于可执行作品）运行目标代码以及修改作品所需的所有源代码，包括控制这些活动的脚本。然而，它不包括作品的系统库，或通用工具或通常可用的、在执行这些活动时未经修改而使用但不是作品一部分的自由程序。例如，对应源代码包括与作品的源文件相关的接口定义文件，以及作品专门设计需要的共享库和动态链接子程序的源代码，例如通过这些子程序与作品其他部分之间的数据通信或控制流。

  对应源代码不需要包括用户可以从对应源代码的其他部分自动重新生成的任何东西。

  源代码形式作品的对应源代码是该作品本身。

  2. 基本许可

  根据本许可证授予的所有权利都是针对程序的版权期限而授予的，并且在满足规定条件的情况下是不可撤销的。本许可证明确确认你运行未修改程序的无限制许可。运行覆盖作品的输出仅在其内容构成覆盖作品时才受本许可证保护。本许可证承认你的合理使用或其他等同权利，如版权法所规定的。

  只要你的许可仍然有效，你可以制作、运行和传播你不传送的覆盖作品，而无需任何条件。你可以将覆盖作品传送给他人，仅出于让他们专门为你进行修改或为你提供运行这些作品的设施的目的，前提是你遵守本许可证的条款来传送你不控制版权的所有材料。因此，为你制作或运行覆盖作品的人必须完全代表你，在你的指导和控制下，以禁止他们在与你的关系之外制作你的受版权保护材料的任何副本的条款进行。

  在任何其他情况下的传送只有在以下规定的条件下才被允许。不允许再许可；第10条使其成为不必要的。

  3. 保护用户的法律权利免受反规避法的影响

  任何覆盖作品都不应被视为根据任何适用法律履行1996年12月20日通过的WIPO版权条约第11条规定的义务，或类似禁止或限制规避此类措施的法律下的有效技术措施的一部分。

  当你传送覆盖作品时，你放弃任何禁止技术措施规避的法律权力，只要这种规避是通过行使本许可证赋予覆盖作品的权利而实现的，并且你否认任何限制作品的操作或修改的意图，作为对抗作品用户的方式来强制你或第三方禁止规避技术措施的法律权利。

  4. 传送完整副本

  你可以在任何媒介上传送你接收到的程序源代码的完整副本，前提是你在每个副本上明显而适当地发布适当的版权声明；完整地保留所有声明本许可证和根据第7条添加的任何非许可性条款适用于代码的声明；完整地保留所有关于没有品质保证的声明；并向所有接收者提供本许可证的副本和程序。

  你可以对你传送的每个副本收取任何价格或免费，并且你可以提供收费的支持或品质保证。

  5. 传送修改的源代码版本

  你可以以源代码形式传送基于程序的作品，或者从程序中产生它的修改，根据第4条的条款，前提是你还满足所有这些条件：

    a) 该作品必须带有醒目的声明，说明你修改了它，并给出相关日期。

    b) 该作品必须带有醒目的声明，说明它是根据本许可证和根据第7条添加的任何条件发布的。这一要求修改了第4条中"完整保留所有声明"的要求。

    c) 你必须将整个作品作为一个整体，根据本许可证授权给任何拥有副本的人。因此，本许可证将与任何适用的第7条附加条款一起适用于整个作品及其所有部分，无论它们如何打包。本许可证不允许以任何其他方式许可作品，但如果你单独收到许可，它不会使这种许可无效。

    d) 如果作品有交互式用户界面，每个界面都必须显示适当的法律声明；但是，如果程序有不显示适当法律声明的交互式界面，你的作品不需要使它们这样做。

  覆盖作品与其他独立作品的汇编，这些作品本质上不是覆盖作品的扩展，并且不与其组合以形成更大的程序，在存储或分发媒介的卷上或卷中，如果汇编及其由此产生的版权不用于限制汇编用户的访问或法律权利超出个别作品所允许的范围，则称为"聚合"。在聚合中包含覆盖作品不会导致本许可证适用于聚合的其他部分。

  6. 传送非源代码形式

  你可以根据第4条和第5条的条款以目标代码形式传送覆盖作品，前提是你还根据本许可证的条款传送机器可读的对应源代码，以以下方式之一：

    a) 将目标代码传送于实体产品中或体现在实体产品中（包括实体分发媒介），伴随着固定在通常用于软件交换的耐用实体媒介上的对应源代码。

    b) 将目标代码传送于实体产品中或体现在实体产品中（包括实体分发媒介），伴随着书面要约，有效期至少三年，并且只要你为该产品型号提供备件或客户支持就有效，向拥有目标代码的任何人提供（1）产品中受本许可证保护的所有软件的对应源代码副本，在通常用于软件交换的耐用实体媒介上，价格不超过你实际执行此源代码传送的合理成本，或（2）免费从网络服务器访问复制对应源代码。

    c) 传送目标代码的个别副本，伴随着提供对应源代码的书面要约副本。这种替代方案仅偶尔和非商业性地允许，并且仅当你收到目标代码伴随着这样的要约时，根据第6b款。

    d) 通过从指定地点提供访问（免费或收费）来传送目标代码，并通过相同的地点以相同的方式提供对应源代码的等效访问，而不收取额外费用。你不需要要求接收者复制对应源代码和目标代码。如果复制目标代码的地点是网络服务器，对应源代码可以在不同的服务器上（由你或第三方运营），该服务器支持等效的复制设施，前提是你在目标代码旁边保持清晰的方向，说明在哪里找到对应源代码。无论什么服务器托管对应源代码，你仍然有义务确保它在满足这些要求所需的时间内可用。

    e) 使用点对点传输传送目标代码，前提是你通知其他对等方在第6d款下免费向公众提供作品的目标代码和对应源代码的位置。

  目标代码的可分离部分，其源代码作为系统库从对应源代码中排除，不需要包括在传送目标代码作品中。

  "用户产品"是（1）"消费产品"，意味着通常用于个人、家庭或家用目的的任何有形个人财产，或（2）任何设计或出售用于并入住宅的东西。在确定产品是否是消费产品时，有疑问的案件应当解决为有利于覆盖。对于特定用户接收的特定产品，"正常使用"是指该类产品的典型或常见用途，无论特定用户的身份或特定用户实际使用或预期或被预期使用产品的方式如何。产品是消费产品，无论产品是否具有实质性的商业、工业或非消费用途，除非这些用途代表产品的唯一重要使用方式。

  用户产品的"安装信息"是指从对应源代码的修改版本安装和执行该用户产品中覆盖作品的修改版本所需的任何方法、程序、授权密钥或其他信息。信息必须足以确保修改的目标代码的持续功能在任何情况下都不会因为进行了修改而被阻止或干扰。

  如果你根据本条在用户产品中、与用户产品一起或专门用于用户产品的情况下传送目标代码作品，并且传送作为交易的一部分发生，其中用户产品的占有和使用权永久地或在固定期限内转移给接收者（无论交易如何表征），根据本条传送的对应源代码必须伴随着安装信息。但如果你或任何第三方都不保留在用户产品上安装修改的目标代码的能力（例如，作品已安装在ROM中），则此要求不适用。

  提供安装信息的要求不包括继续提供支持服务、品质保证或接收者修改或安装的作品或已修改或安装了作品的用户产品的更新的要求。当修改本身实质上和不利地影响网络的操作或违反网络通信的规则和协议时，可以拒绝对网络的访问。

  根据本条传送的对应源代码和提供的安装信息必须是公开记录的格式（并且有可供公众使用的源代码形式的实现），并且必须不需要特殊密码或密钥来解包、阅读或复制。

  7. 附加条款

  "附加许可"是通过从本许可证的一个或多个条件中做出例外来补充本许可证条款的条款。适用于整个程序的附加许可应被视为包含在本许可证中，在它们根据适用法律有效的范围内。如果附加许可仅适用于程序的一部分，该部分可以在这些许可下单独使用，但整个程序仍受本许可证的约束，而不考虑附加许可。

  当你传送覆盖作品的副本时，你可以选择从该副本或其任何部分中删除任何附加许可。（附加许可可能被写成要求在你修改作品的某些情况下删除它们。）你可以在你添加到覆盖作品的材料上放置附加许可，对于这些材料你有或可以给予适当的版权许可。

  尽管本许可证有任何其他规定，对于你添加到覆盖作品的材料，如果得到该材料版权持有人的授权，你可以用以下条款补充本许可证的条款：

    a) 以不同于本许可证第15条和第16条的条款否认品质保证或限制责任；或

    b) 要求在该材料中或在包含它的作品显示的适当法律声明中保留指定的合理法律声明或作者归属；或

    c) 禁止对该材料的来源进行虚假陈述，或要求该材料的修改版本以合理的方式标记为与原始版本不同；或

    d) 限制为宣传目的使用该材料的许可人或作者的姓名；或

    e) 拒绝根据商标法授予使用某些商品名称、商标或服务标记的权利；或

    f) 要求任何传送该材料（或其修改版本）的人对接收者承担责任的合同性假设进行赔偿，对于这些合同性假设直接施加给这些许可人和作者的任何责任。

  所有其他非许可性附加条款都被视为第10条含义内的"进一步限制"。如果你收到的程序或其任何部分包含一个声明，说明它受本许可证和一个进一步限制条款的约束，你可以删除该条款。如果许可证文档包含进一步限制，但允许根据本许可证重新许可或传送，你可以向覆盖作品添加受该许可证文档条款约束的材料，前提是进一步限制不会在这种重新许可或传送中存续。

  如果你根据本条向覆盖作品添加条款，你必须在相关源文件中放置一个声明，说明适用于这些文件的附加条款，或者一个指示在哪里找到适用条款的声明。

  附加条款，无论是许可性的还是非许可性的，都可以以单独书面的许可证的形式说明，或作为例外说明；以上要求以任何一种方式适用。

  8. 终止

  除非根据本许可证明确规定，否则你不得传播或修改覆盖作品。任何其他传播或修改它的尝试都是无效的，并将自动终止你在本许可证下的权利（包括根据第11条第三段授予的任何专利许可）。

  但是，如果你停止所有违反本许可证的行为，那么来自特定版权持有人的许可将被恢复（a）临时性地，除非和直到版权持有人明确并最终终止你的许可，以及（b）永久性地，如果版权持有人未能在停止后60天内以某种合理方式通知你违规。

  此外，如果版权持有人以某种合理方式通知你违规，这是你第一次从该版权持有人收到违反本许可证（对于任何作品）的通知，并且你在收到通知后30天内纠正违规，那么来自特定版权持有人的许可将被永久恢复。

  根据本条终止你的权利不会终止根据本许可证从你那里接收副本或权利的当事方的许可。如果你的权利已被终止且未永久恢复，你没有资格根据第10条接收相同材料的新许可。

  9. 拥有副本不需要接受

  你不需要接受本许可证才能接收或运行程序的副本。仅因使用点对点传输接收副本而发生的覆盖作品的辅助传播同样不需要接受。但是，除本许可证外，没有其他任何东西授予你传播或修改任何覆盖作品的许可。如果你不接受本许可证，这些行为侵犯版权。因此，通过修改或传播覆盖作品，你表示你接受本许可证来这样做。

  10. 下游接收者的自动许可

  每次你传送覆盖作品时，接收者自动从原始许可人那里获得运行、修改和传播该作品的许可，受本许可证的约束。你不负责强制第三方遵守本许可证。

  "实体交易"是转移组织控制权的交易，或转移组织的实质上所有资产，或细分组织，或合并组织。如果覆盖作品的传播是实体交易的结果，那么接收作品副本的交易的每一方也接收作品的任何许可，该方的前任在利益中拥有或可以根据前一段给予，加上从前任那里占有作品对应源代码的权利，如果前任拥有它或可以通过合理的努力获得它。

  你不得对根据本许可证授予或确认的权利的行使施加任何进一步的限制。例如，你不得施加许可费、版税或其他行使根据本许可证授予的权利的费用，并且你不得提起诉讼（包括诉讼中的交叉索赔或反诉），指控通过制作、使用、销售、提供销售或导入程序或其任何部分侵犯了任何专利权利要求。

  11. 专利

  "贡献者"是根据本许可证授权使用程序或程序所基于的作品的版权持有人。因此许可的作品称为贡献者的"贡献者版本"。

  贡献者的"基本专利权利要求"是由贡献者拥有或控制的所有专利权利要求，无论是已经获得的还是以后获得的，这些权利要求将以本许可证允许的某种方式，通过制作、使用或销售其贡献者版本而被侵犯，但不包括仅因进一步修改贡献者版本而被侵犯的权利要求。对于本定义的目的，"控制"包括以与本许可证的要求一致的方式授予专利再许可的权利。

  每个贡献者根据贡献者的基本专利权利要求授予你非独占的、全球性的、免版税的专利许可，以制作、使用、销售、提供销售、导入以及以其他方式运行、修改和传播其贡献者版本的内容。

  在以下三段中，"专利许可"是任何明示协议或承诺，无论如何命名，不执行专利（例如明示许可实践专利或不起诉专利侵权的契约）。向一方"授予"这样的专利许可意味着做出这样的协议或承诺不对该方执行专利。

  如果你传送覆盖作品，明知依赖专利许可，并且作品的对应源代码不可供任何人根据本许可证的条款通过公开可用的网络服务器或其他容易访问的方式免费复制，那么你必须（1）使对应源代码如此可用，或（2）安排剥夺你自己对这个特定作品的专利许可的利益，或（3）以与本许可证的要求一致的方式安排将专利许可扩展到下游接收者。"明知依赖"意味着你有实际知识，但对于专利许可，你在一个国家传送覆盖作品，或你的接收者在一个国家使用覆盖作品，将侵犯该国家的一个或多个可识别的专利，你有理由相信这些专利是有效的。

  如果根据或与单一交易或安排相关，你传送或通过促成传送的方式传播覆盖作品，并向接收覆盖作品的某些方授予专利许可，授权他们使用、传播、修改或传送覆盖作品的特定副本，那么你授予的专利许可自动扩展到覆盖作品和基于它的作品的所有接收者。

  如果专利许可不包括在其覆盖范围内，禁止行使，或以不行使一个或多个根据本许可证特别授予的权利为条件，则专利许可是"歧视性的"。如果你是与从事分发软件业务的第三方的安排的一方，根据该安排你根据你传送作品活动的程度向第三方付款，并且根据该安排第三方向将从你那里接收覆盖作品的任何方授予歧视性专利许可（a）与你传送的覆盖作品的副本（或从这些副本制作的副本）相关，或（b）主要用于和与包含覆盖作品的特定产品或汇编相关，则你不得传送覆盖作品，除非你在2007年3月28日之前进入该安排，或该专利许可在此之前被授予。

  本许可证中的任何内容都不应被解释为排除或限制任何暗示许可或其他对根据适用专利法可能对你可用的侵权的其他辩护。

  12. 不得放弃他人的自由

  如果对你施加条件（无论是通过法院命令、协议还是其他方式），这些条件与本许可证的条件相矛盾，它们不免除你本许可证的条件。如果你不能传送覆盖作品以同时满足你在本许可证下的义务和任何其他相关义务，那么作为结果你根本不得传送它。例如，如果你同意的条款要求你从你传送程序的人那里收取版税以进一步传送，那么你同时满足这些条款和本许可证的唯一方法是完全不传送程序。

  13. 与 GNU Affero 通用公共许可证一起使用

  尽管本许可证有任何其他规定，你有权将任何覆盖作品与根据 GNU Affero 通用公共许可证第3版许可的作品链接或组合成单个组合作品，并传送结果作品。本许可证的条款将继续适用于作为覆盖作品的部分，但 GNU Affero 通用公共许可证第13条关于通过网络交互的特殊要求将适用于该组合本身。

  14. 本许可证的修订版本

  自由软件基金会可能会不时发布 GNU 通用公共许可证的修订版和/或新版本。这些新版本在精神上将与当前版本相似，但可能在细节上有所不同，以解决新问题或关注点。

  每个版本都被赋予一个区分版本号。如果程序指定适用于它的 GNU 通用公共许可证的某个编号版本"或任何更高版本"，你可以选择遵循该编号版本或由自由软件基金会发布的任何更高版本的条款和条件。如果程序未指定 GNU 通用公共许可证的版本号，你可以选择自由软件基金会发布的任何版本。

  如果程序指定代理可以决定哪些 GNU 通用公共许可证的未来版本可以使用，该代理的公开声明接受版本将永久授权你为程序选择该版本。

  更高版本的许可证可能会给你额外或不同的许可。但是，由于你选择遵循更高版本，不会对任何作者或版权持有人施加额外的义务。

  15. 免责声明

  在适用法律允许的范围内，该程序没有品质保证。除非另有书面说明，版权持有人和/或其他方"按原样"提供程序，没有任何明示或暗示的保证，包括但不限于对适销性和特定用途适用性的暗示保证。程序的质量和性能的全部风险由你承担。如果程序被证明有缺陷，你承担所有必要的服务、修理或纠正的费用。

  16. 责任限制

  在任何情况下，除非适用法律要求或书面同意，任何版权持有人或根据上述许可修改和/或传送程序的任何其他方都不对你的损害负责，包括因使用或无法使用程序而产生的任何一般、特殊、偶然或后果性损害（包括但不限于数据丢失或数据呈现不准确或你或第三方遭受的损失或程序无法与任何其他程序一起操作），即使该持有人或其他方已被告知此类损害的可能性。

  17. 第15条和第16条的解释

  如果上述免责声明和责任限制根据其条款不能产生当地法律效力，审查法院应适用最接近于与程序相关的所有民事责任的绝对豁免的当地法律，除非品质保证或责任假设伴随程序的副本以收取费用。

                     条款和条件结束

            如何将这些条款应用于你的新程序

  如果你开发了一个新程序，并且你希望它对公众尽可能有用，实现这一目标的最好方法是使它成为自由软件，每个人都可以根据这些条款重新分发和修改它。

  要这样做，请将以下声明附加到程序中。最安全的方法是将它们附加到每个源文件的开头，以最有效地说明排除品质保证；并且每个文件应至少有"版权"行和指向完整声明所在位置的指针。

    <用一行给出程序名称和它的功能的简要说明。>
    版权所有 (C) <年份>  <作者姓名>

    本程序是自由软件：你可以根据自由软件基金会发布的 GNU 通用公共许可证的条款重新分发它和/或修改它，许可证的第3版，或（根据你的选择）任何更高版本。

    本程序的分发是希望它会有用，但没有任何保证；甚至没有对适销性或特定用途适用性的暗示保证。有关更多详细信息，请参阅 GNU 通用公共许可证。

    你应该已经收到 GNU 通用公共许可证的副本和本程序。如果没有，请参阅 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>。

还要添加如何通过电子邮件和纸质邮件联系你的信息。

  如果程序进行终端交互，在它以交互模式启动时让它输出一个简短的声明，如下所示：

    <程序>  版权所有 (C) <年份>  <作者姓名>
    本程序完全没有品质保证；详情请键入 `show w'。
    这是自由软件，欢迎你在某些条件下重新分发它；
    详情请键入 `show c'。

假设的命令 `show w' 和 `show c' 应显示 GNU 通用公共许可证的相应部分。当然，你的程序的命令可能不同；对于 GUI 界面，你会使用"关于"框。

  如果需要，你还应该让你的雇主（如果你作为程序员工作）或学校为程序签署"版权免责声明"。有关这方面的更多信息，以及如何应用和遵循 GNU GPL，请参阅 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>。

  GNU 通用公共许可证不允许将你的程序并入专有程序。如果你的程序是子例程库，你可能认为允许将专有应用程序与该库链接更有用。如果这是你想要做的，请使用 GNU 宽松通用公共许可证而不是本许可证。但首先，请阅读 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>。

 版權所有 (C) 2007 自由軟體基金會 <https://fsf.org/>

 任何人都可以複製和散布本授權的完整副本，但不允許修改。

                            前言

  GNU 通用公共授權是一份面向軟體及其他類型作品的自由的、著佐權的授權。

  大多數軟體及其他實用作品的授權都是為了剝奪你分享和修改作品的自由。相反，GNU 通用公共授權的目的是保證你分享和修改某程式全部版本的自由——確保它對所有使用者都是自由軟體。我們，自由軟體基金會，在我們的大多數軟體中使用 GNU 通用公共授權；它也適用於任何以這種方式發布的作品。你也可以將它應用於你的程式。

  當我們談到自由軟體時，我們指的是自由，而不是價格。我們的通用公共授權旨在確保你擁有散布自由軟體副本的自由（如果你願意，可以為此收費），確保你可以收到原始碼或者在你需要時可以得到它，確保你可以修改軟體或將它的一部分用於新的自由軟體，並且確保你知道你可以做這些事情。

  為了保護你的權利，我們需要防止其他人否認你這些權利或要求你放棄這些權利。因此，如果你散布該軟體的副本，或者修改它，你就有一定的責任：尊重他人的自由。

  例如，如果你散布這樣一個程式的副本，無論是免費的還是收費的，你必須將你獲得的自由同樣傳遞給接收者。你必須確保他們也能收到或者可以獲得原始碼。並且你必須向他們展示這些條款，以便他們知道他們的權利。

  使用 GNU GPL 的開發者透過兩個步驟保護你的權利：（1）宣告軟體的版權；（2）透過本授權授予你複製、散布和/或修改軟體的合法權限。

  為了保護開發者和作者，GPL 明確說明自由軟體是沒有品質保證的。為了使用者和作者的利益，GPL 要求修改版本必須標註為已更改，以便它們的問題不會被錯誤地歸咎於先前版本的作者。

  某些裝置被設計為拒絕使用者安裝或執行其內部軟體的修改版本，儘管製造商可以這樣做。這與保護使用者修改軟體自由的目的根本不相容。這種濫用的系統模式發生在個人使用的產品領域，這恰恰是最不可接受的。因此，我們設計了這個版本的 GPL 來禁止這些產品的此類做法。如果這樣的問題在其他領域大量出現，我們準備在 GPL 的未來版本中將此條款擴展到這些領域，以保護使用者的自由。

  最後，每個程式都不斷受到軟體專利的威脅。國家不應該允許專利限制通用電腦軟體的開發和使用，但在那些允許的國家，我們希望避免專利應用於自由程式而使其變為專有程式的特殊危險。為了防止這種情況，GPL 保證專利不能用於使程式變為非自由的。

  以下是有關複製、散布和修改的詳細條款和條件。

                       條款和條件

  0. 定義

  "本授權"指 GNU 通用公共授權第三版。

  "版權"也指適用於其他類型作品（如半導體光罩）的版權類法律。

  "程式"指任何受本授權保護的可版權作品。每個被授權人稱為"你"。"被授權人"和"接收者"可以是個人或組織。

  "修改"一個作品是指需要版權許可的方式複製或改編作品的全部或部分，而不是製作完全相同的副本。所得作品稱為早期作品的"修改版本"或"基於"早期作品的作品。

  "涵蓋作品"是指未修改的程式或基於程式的作品。

  "傳播"作品是指在未經許可的情況下，根據適用的版權法，會使你直接或間接承擔侵權責任的任何行為，除了在電腦上執行它或修改私有副本。傳播包括複製、散布（無論是否修改）、向公眾提供，以及在某些國家的其他活動。

  "轉送"作品是指任何使其他方能夠製作或接收副本的傳播。僅透過電腦網路與使用者互動，而不轉移副本，不是轉送。

  一個互動式使用者介面在如下範圍內顯示"適當的法律聲明"：它包括一個方便且醒目可見的功能，該功能（1）顯示適當的版權聲明，（2）告知使用者該作品沒有品質保證（提供品質保證的情況除外），被授權人可以在本授權下轉送該作品，以及如何檢視本授權的副本。如果介面呈現使用者命令或選項清單，例如選單，清單中的醒目項目符合此標準。

  1. 原始碼

  一個作品的"原始碼"是指對作品進行修改的首選形式。"目的碼"是指作品的任何非原始碼形式。

  "標準介面"是指由公認的標準機構定義的官方標準的介面，或者，對於為特定程式語言指定的介面，是在使用該語言的開發者中廣泛使用的介面。

  可執行作品的"系統函式庫"包括除整個作品之外的任何東西，這些東西（a）以封裝主要元件的正常形式包含在內，但不是該主要元件的一部分，並且（b）僅用於使作品能夠與該主要元件一起使用，或實作對公眾可用的原始碼形式的標準介面。在這種情況下，"主要元件"是指可執行作品執行所在的特定作業系統（如果有的話）的主要基本元件（核心、視窗系統等），或用於產生作品的編譯器，或用於執行它的目的碼解譯器。

  目的碼形式作品的"對應原始碼"是指產生、安裝和（對於可執行作品）執行目的碼以及修改作品所需的所有原始碼，包括控制這些活動的指令碼。然而，它不包括作品的系統函式庫，或通用工具或通常可用的、在執行這些活動時未經修改而使用但不是作品一部分的自由程式。例如，對應原始碼包括與作品的原始檔案相關的介面定義檔案，以及作品專門設計需要的共用函式庫和動態連結子程式的原始碼，例如透過這些子程式與作品其他部分之間的資料通訊或控制流。

  對應原始碼不需要包括使用者可以從對應原始碼的其他部分自動重新產生的任何東西。

  原始碼形式作品的對應原始碼是該作品本身。

  2. 基本授權

  根據本授權授予的所有權利都是針對程式的版權期限而授予的，並且在滿足規定條件的情況下是不可撤銷的。本授權明確確認你執行未修改程式的無限制授權。執行涵蓋作品的輸出僅在其內容構成涵蓋作品時才受本授權保護。本授權承認你的合理使用或其他等同權利，如版權法所規定的。

  只要你的授權仍然有效，你可以製作、執行和傳播你不轉送的涵蓋作品，而無需任何條件。你可以將涵蓋作品轉送給他人，僅出於讓他們專門為你進行修改或為你提供執行這些作品的設施的目的，前提是你遵守本授權的條款來轉送你不控制版權的所有材料。因此，為你製作或執行涵蓋作品的人必須完全代表你，在你的指導和控制下，以禁止他們在與你的關係之外製作你的受版權保護材料的任何副本的條款進行。

  在任何其他情況下的轉送只有在以下規定的條件下才被允許。不允許再授權；第10條使其成為不必要的。

  3. 保護使用者的法律權利免受反規避法的影響

  任何涵蓋作品都不應被視為根據任何適用法律履行1996年12月20日透過的WIPO版權條約第11條規定的義務，或類似禁止或限制規避此類措施的法律下的有效技術措施的一部分。

  當你轉送涵蓋作品時，你放棄任何禁止技術措施規避的法律權力，只要這種規避是透過行使本授權賦予涵蓋作品的權利而實現的，並且你否認任何限制作品的操作或修改的意圖，作為對抗作品使用者的方式來強制你或第三方禁止規避技術措施的法律權利。

  4. 轉送完整副本

  你可以在任何媒介上轉送你接收到的程式原始碼的完整副本，前提是你在每個副本上明顯而適當地發布適當的版權聲明；完整地保留所有宣告本授權和根據第7條新增的任何非授權性條款適用於程式碼的宣告；完整地保留所有關於沒有品質保證的宣告；並向所有接收者提供本授權的副本和程式。

  你可以對你轉送的每個副本收取任何價格或免費，並且你可以提供收費的支援或品質保證。

  5. 轉送修改的原始碼版本

  你可以以原始碼形式轉送基於程式的作品，或者從程式中產生它的修改，根據第4條的條款，前提是你還滿足所有這些條件：

    a) 該作品必須帶有醒目的宣告，說明你修改了它，並給出相關日期。

    b) 該作品必須帶有醒目的宣告，說明它是根據本授權和根據第7條新增的任何條件發布的。這一要求修改了第4條中"完整保留所有宣告"的要求。

    c) 你必須將整個作品作為一個整體，根據本授權授權給任何擁有副本的人。因此，本授權將與任何適用的第7條附加條款一起適用於整個作品及其所有部分，無論它們如何封裝。本授權不允許以任何其他方式授權作品，但如果你單獨收到授權，它不會使這種授權無效。

    d) 如果作品有互動式使用者介面，每個介面都必須顯示適當的法律聲明；但是，如果程式有不顯示適當法律聲明的互動式介面，你的作品不需要使它們這樣做。

  涵蓋作品與其他獨立作品的彙編，這些作品本質上不是涵蓋作品的擴充套件，並且不與其組合以形成更大的程式，在儲存或散布媒介的卷上或卷中，如果彙編及其由此產生的版權不用於限制彙編使用者的存取或法律權利超出個別作品所允許的範圍，則稱為"聚合"。在聚合中包含涵蓋作品不會導致本授權適用於聚合的其他部分。

  6. 轉送非原始碼形式

  你可以根據第4條和第5條的條款以目的碼形式轉送涵蓋作品，前提是你還根據本授權的條款轉送機器可讀的對應原始碼，以以下方式之一：

    a) 將目的碼轉送於實體產品中或體現在實體產品中（包括實體散布媒介），伴隨著固定在通常用於軟體交換的耐用實體媒介上的對應原始碼。

    b) 將目的碼轉送於實體產品中或體現在實體產品中（包括實體散布媒介），伴隨著書面要約，有效期至少三年，並且只要你為該產品型號提供備品或客戶支援就有效，向擁有目的碼的任何人提供（1）產品中受本授權保護的所有軟體的對應原始碼副本，在通常用於軟體交換的耐用實體媒介上，價格不超過你實際執行此原始碼轉送的合理成本，或（2）免費從網路伺服器存取複製對應原始碼。

    c) 轉送目的碼的個別副本，伴隨著提供對應原始碼的書面要約副本。這種替代方案僅偶爾和非商業性地允許，並且僅當你收到目的碼伴隨著這樣的要約時，根據第6b款。

    d) 透過從指定地點提供存取（免費或收費）來轉送目的碼，並透過相同的地點以相同的方式提供對應原始碼的等效存取，而不收取額外費用。你不需要要求接收者複製對應原始碼和目的碼。如果複製目的碼的地點是網路伺服器，對應原始碼可以在不同的伺服器上（由你或第三方營運），該伺服器支援等效的複製設施，前提是你在目的碼旁邊保持清晰的方向，說明在哪裡找到對應原始碼。無論什麼伺服器託管對應原始碼，你仍然有義務確保它在滿足這些要求所需的時間內可用。

    e) 使用點對點傳輸轉送目的碼，前提是你通知其他對等方在第6d款下免費向公眾提供作品的目的碼和對應原始碼的位置。

  目的碼的可分離部分，其原始碼作為系統函式庫從對應原始碼中排除，不需要包括在轉送目的碼作品中。

  "使用者產品"是（1）"消費產品"，意味著通常用於個人、家庭或家用目的的任何有形個人財產，或（2）任何設計或出售用於併入住宅的東西。在確定產品是否是消費產品時，有疑問的案件應當解決為有利於涵蓋。對於特定使用者接收的特定產品，"正常使用"是指該類產品的典型或常見用途，無論特定使用者的身分或特定使用者實際使用或預期或被預期使用產品的方式如何。產品是消費產品，無論產品是否具有實質性的商業、工業或非消費用途，除非這些用途代表產品的唯一重要使用方式。

  使用者產品的"安裝資訊"是指從對應原始碼的修改版本安裝和執行該使用者產品中涵蓋作品的修改版本所需的任何方法、程式、授權金鑰或其他資訊。資訊必須足以確保修改的目的碼的持續功能在任何情況下都不會因為進行了修改而被阻止或干擾。

  如果你根據本條在使用者產品中、與使用者產品一起或專門用於使用者產品的情況下轉送目的碼作品，並且轉送作為交易的一部分發生，其中使用者產品的佔有和使用權永久地或在固定期限內轉移給接收者（無論交易如何表徵），根據本條轉送的對應原始碼必須伴隨著安裝資訊。但如果你或任何第三方都不保留在使用者產品上安裝修改的目的碼的能力（例如，作品已安裝在ROM中），則此要求不適用。

  提供安裝資訊的要求不包括繼續提供支援服務、品質保證或接收者修改或安裝的作品或已修改或安裝了作品的使用者產品的更新的要求。當修改本身實質上和不利地影響網路的操作或違反網路通訊的規則和協定時，可以拒絕對網路的存取。

  根據本條轉送的對應原始碼和提供的安裝資訊必須是公開記錄的格式（並且有可供公眾使用的原始碼形式的實作），並且必須不需要特殊密碼或金鑰來解包、閱讀或複製。

  7. 附加條款

  "附加授權"是透過從本授權的一個或多個條件中做出例外來補充本授權條款的條款。適用於整個程式的附加授權應被視為包含在本授權中，在它們根據適用法律有效的範圍內。如果附加授權僅適用於程式的一部分，該部分可以在這些授權下單獨使用，但整個程式仍受本授權的約束，而不考慮附加授權。

  當你轉送涵蓋作品的副本時，你可以選擇從該副本或其任何部分中刪除任何附加授權。（附加授權可能被寫成要求在你修改作品的某些情況下刪除它們。）你可以在你新增到涵蓋作品的材料上放置附加授權，對於這些材料你有或可以給予適當的版權授權。

  儘管本授權有任何其他規定，對於你新增到涵蓋作品的材料，如果得到該材料版權持有人的授權，你可以用以下條款補充本授權的條款：

    a) 以不同於本授權第15條和第16條的條款否認品質保證或限制責任；或

    b) 要求在該材料中或在包含它的作品顯示的適當法律聲明中保留指定的合理法律聲明或作者歸屬；或

    c) 禁止對該材料的來源進行虛假陳述，或要求該材料的修改版本以合理的方式標記為與原始版本不同；或

    d) 限制為宣傳目的使用該材料的授權人或作者的姓名；或

    e) 拒絕根據商標法授予使用某些商品名稱、商標或服務標記的權利；或

    f) 要求任何轉送該材料（或其修改版本）的人對接收者承擔責任的合約性假設進行賠償，對於這些合約性假設直接施加給這些授權人和作者的任何責任。

  所有其他非授權性附加條款都被視為第10條含義內的"進一步限制"。如果你收到的程式或其任何部分包含一個宣告，說明它受本授權和一個進一步限制條款的約束，你可以刪除該條款。如果授權文件包含進一步限制，但允許根據本授權重新授權或轉送，你可以向涵蓋作品新增受該授權文件條款約束的材料，前提是進一步限制不會在這種重新授權或轉送中存續。

  如果你根據本條向涵蓋作品新增條款，你必須在相關原始檔案中放置一個宣告，說明適用於這些檔案的附加條款，或者一個指示在哪裡找到適用條款的宣告。

  附加條款，無論是授權性的還是非授權性的，都可以以單獨書寫的授權的形式說明，或作為例外說明；以上要求以任何一種方式適用。

  8. 終止

  除非根據本授權明確規定，否則你不得傳播或修改涵蓋作品。任何其他傳播或修改它的嘗試都是無效的，並將自動終止你在本授權下的權利（包括根據第11條第三段授予的任何專利授權）。

  但是，如果你停止所有違反本授權的行為，那麼來自特定版權持有人的授權將被恢復（a）臨時性地，除非和直到版權持有人明確並最終終止你的授權，以及（b）永久性地，如果版權持有人未能在停止後60天內以某種合理方式通知你違規。

  此外，如果版權持有人以某種合理方式通知你違規，這是你第一次從該版權持有人收到違反本授權（對於任何作品）的通知，並且你在收到通知後30天內糾正違規，那麼來自特定版權持有人的授權將被永久恢復。

  根據本條終止你的權利不會終止根據本授權從你那裡接收副本或權利的當事方的授權。如果你的權利已被終止且未永久恢復，你沒有資格根據第10條接收相同材料的新授權。

  9. 擁有副本不需要接受

  你不需要接受本授權才能接收或執行程式的副本。僅因使用點對點傳輸接收副本而發生的涵蓋作品的輔助傳播同樣不需要接受。但是，除本授權外，沒有其他任何東西授予你傳播或修改任何涵蓋作品的授權。如果你不接受本授權，這些行為侵犯版權。因此，透過修改或傳播涵蓋作品，你表示你接受本授權來這樣做。

  10. 下游接收者的自動授權

  每次你轉送涵蓋作品時,接收者自動從原始授權人那裡獲得執行、修改和傳播該作品的授權，受本授權的約束。你不負責強制第三方遵守本授權。

  "實體交易"是轉移組織控制權的交易，或轉移組織的實質上所有資產，或細分組織，或合併組織。如果涵蓋作品的傳播是實體交易的結果，那麼接收作品副本的交易的每一方也接收作品的任何授權，該方的前任在利益中擁有或可以根據前一段給予，加上從前任那裡佔有作品對應原始碼的權利，如果前任擁有它或可以透過合理的努力獲得它。

  你不得對根據本授權授予或確認的權利的行使施加任何進一步的限制。例如，你不得施加授權費、版權費或其他行使根據本授權授予的權利的費用，並且你不得提起訴訟（包括訴訟中的交叉索賠或反訴），指控透過製作、使用、銷售、提供銷售或匯入程式或其任何部分侵犯了任何專利權利要求。

  11. 專利

  "貢獻者"是根據本授權授權使用程式或程式所基於的作品的版權持有人。因此授權的作品稱為貢獻者的"貢獻者版本"。

  貢獻者的"基本專利權利要求"是由貢獻者擁有或控制的所有專利權利要求，無論是已經獲得的還是以後獲得的，這些權利要求將以本授權允許的某種方式，透過製作、使用或銷售其貢獻者版本而被侵犯，但不包括僅因進一步修改貢獻者版本而被侵犯的權利要求。對於本定義的目的，"控制"包括以與本授權的要求一致的方式授予專利再授權的權利。

  每個貢獻者根據貢獻者的基本專利權利要求授予你非獨佔的、全球性的、免版權費的專利授權，以製作、使用、銷售、提供銷售、匯入以及以其他方式執行、修改和傳播其貢獻者版本的內容。

  在以下三段中，"專利授權"是任何明示協議或承諾，無論如何命名，不執行專利（例如明示許可實踐專利或不起訴專利侵權的契約）。向一方"授予"這樣的專利授權意味著做出這樣的協議或承諾不對該方執行專利。

  如果你轉送涵蓋作品，明知依賴專利授權，並且作品的對應原始碼不可供任何人根據本授權的條款透過公開可用的網路伺服器或其他容易存取的方式免費複製，那麼你必須（1）使對應原始碼如此可用，或（2）安排剝奪你自己對這個特定作品的專利授權的利益，或（3）以與本授權的要求一致的方式安排將專利授權擴充套件到下游接收者。"明知依賴"意味著你有實際知識，但對於專利授權，你在一個國家轉送涵蓋作品，或你的接收者在一個國家使用涵蓋作品，將侵犯該國家的一個或多個可識別的專利，你有理由相信這些專利是有效的。

  如果根據或與單一交易或安排相關，你轉送或透過促成轉送的方式傳播涵蓋作品，並向接收涵蓋作品的某些方授予專利授權，授權他們使用、傳播、修改或轉送涵蓋作品的特定副本，那麼你授予的專利授權自動擴充套件到涵蓋作品和基於它的作品的所有接收者。

  如果專利授權不包括在其涵蓋範圍內，禁止行使，或以不行使一個或多個根據本授權特別授予的權利為條件，則專利授權是"歧視性的"。如果你是與從事散布軟體業務的第三方的安排的一方，根據該安排你根據你轉送作品活動的程度向第三方付款，並且根據該安排第三方向將從你那裡接收涵蓋作品的任何方授予歧視性專利授權（a）與你轉送的涵蓋作品的副本（或從這些副本製作的副本）相關，或（b）主要用於和與包含涵蓋作品的特定產品或彙編相關，則你不得轉送涵蓋作品，除非你在2007年3月28日之前進入該安排，或該專利授權在此之前被授予。

  本授權中的任何內容都不應被解釋為排除或限制任何暗示授權或其他對根據適用專利法可能對你可用的侵權的其他抗辯。

  12. 不得放棄他人的自由

  如果對你施加條件（無論是透過法院命令、協議還是其他方式），這些條件與本授權的條件相矛盾，它們不免除你本授權的條件。如果你不能轉送涵蓋作品以同時滿足你在本授權下的義務和任何其他相關義務，那麼作為結果你根本不得轉送它。例如，如果你同意的條款要求你從你轉送程式的人那裡收取版權費以進一步轉送，那麼你同時滿足這些條款和本授權的唯一方法是完全不轉送程式。

  13. 與 GNU Affero 通用公共授權一起使用

  儘管本授權有任何其他規定，你有權將任何涵蓋作品與根據 GNU Affero 通用公共授權第3版授權的作品連結或組合成單個組合作品，並轉送結果作品。本授權的條款將繼續適用於作為涵蓋作品的部分，但 GNU Affero 通用公共授權第13條關於透過網路互動的特殊要求將適用於該組合本身。

  14. 本授權的修訂版本

  自由軟體基金會可能會不時發布 GNU 通用公共授權的修訂版和/或新版本。這些新版本在精神上將與當前版本相似，但可能在細節上有所不同，以解決新問題或關注點。

  每個版本都被賦予一個區分版本號。如果程式指定適用於它的 GNU 通用公共授權的某個編號版本"或任何更高版本"，你可以選擇遵循該編號版本或由自由軟體基金會發布的任何更高版本的條款和條件。如果程式未指定 GNU 通用公共授權的版本號，你可以選擇自由軟體基金會發布的任何版本。

  如果程式指定代理可以決定哪些 GNU 通用公共授權的未來版本可以使用，該代理的公開宣告接受版本將永久授權你為程式選擇該版本。

  更高版本的授權可能會給你額外或不同的授權。但是，由於你選擇遵循更高版本，不會對任何作者或版權持有人施加額外的義務。

  15. 免責宣告

  在適用法律允許的範圍內，該程式沒有品質保證。除非另有書面說明，版權持有人和/或其他方"按原樣"提供程式，沒有任何明示或暗示的保證，包括但不限於對適銷性和特定用途適用性的暗示保證。程式的品質和效能的全部風險由你承擔。如果程式被證明有缺陷，你承擔所有必要的服務、修理或糾正的費用。

  16. 責任限制

  在任何情況下，除非適用法律要求或書面同意，任何版權持有人或根據上述授權修改和/或轉送程式的任何其他方都不對你的損害負責，包括因使用或無法使用程式而產生的任何一般、特殊、偶然或後果性損害（包括但不限於資料丟失或資料呈現不準確或你或第三方遭受的損失或程式無法與任何其他程式一起操作），即使該持有人或其他方已被告知此類損害的可能性。

  17. 第15條和第16條的解釋

  如果上述免責宣告和責任限制根據其條款不能產生當地法律效力，審查法院應適用最接近於與程式相關的所有民事責任的絕對豁免的當地法律，除非品質保證或責任假設伴隨程式的副本以收取費用。

                     條款和條件結束

            如何將這些條款應用於你的新程式

  如果你開發了一個新程式，並且你希望它對公眾儘可能有用，實現這一目標的最好方法是使它成為自由軟體，每個人都可以根據這些條款重新散布和修改它。

  要這樣做，請將以下宣告附加到程式中。最安全的方法是將它們附加到每個原始檔案的開頭，以最有效地說明排除品質保證；並且每個檔案應至少有"版權"行和指向完整宣告所在位置的指標。

    <用一行給出程式名稱和它的功能的簡要說明。>
    版權所有 (C) <年份>  <作者姓名>

    本程式是自由軟體：你可以根據自由軟體基金會發布的 GNU 通用公共授權的條款重新散布它和/或修改它，授權的第3版，或（根據你的選擇）任何更高版本。

    本程式的散布是希望它會有用，但沒有任何保證；甚至沒有對適銷性或特定用途適用性的暗示保證。有關更多詳細資訊，請參閱 GNU 通用公共授權。

    你應該已經收到 GNU 通用公共授權的副本和本程式。如果沒有，請參閱 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>。

還要新增如何透過電子郵件和紙質郵件聯絡你的資訊。

  如果程式進行終端互動，在它以互動模式啟動時讓它輸出一個簡短的宣告，如下所示：

    <程式>  版權所有 (C) <年份>  <作者姓名>
    本程式完全沒有品質保證；詳情請鍵入 `show w'。
    這是自由軟體，歡迎你在某些條件下重新散布它；
    詳情請鍵入 `show c'。

假設的命令 `show w' 和 `show c' 應顯示 GNU 通用公共授權的相應部分。當然，你的程式的命令可能不同；對於 GUI 介面，你會使用"關於"框。

  如果需要，你還應該讓你的僱主（如果你作為程式設計師工作）或學校為程式簽署"版權免責宣告"。有關這方面的更多資訊，以及如何應用和遵循 GNU GPL，請參閱 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>。

  GNU 通用公共授權不允許將你的程式併入專有程式。如果你的程式是子例程函式庫，你可能認為允許將專有應用程式與該函式庫連結更有用。如果這是你想要做的，請使用 GNU 寬鬆通用公共授權而不是本授權。但首先，請閱讀 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>。
